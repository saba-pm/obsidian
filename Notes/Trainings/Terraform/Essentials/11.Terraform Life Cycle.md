l1. **prevent_destroy**
		This lifecycle option prevents Terraform from accidentally removing critical resources. When it is set to true, terraform will reject any changes that will result in the resource getting.
1. **create_before_destroy**
		use the `create_before_destroy` attribute to create your new resource before destroying the old resource
3. **ignore_changes**
		The [Terraform ignore_changes lifecycle option](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-ignore-changes) can be useful when attributes of a resource are updated outside of Terraform.
4.  **precondition and postcondition**
		The `precondition` block is used to ensure a certain condition is met before the resource is created, and the `postcondition` block is used to execute specific actions or checks after the resource is created.

Exampl:
1. prevent_destroy
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "critical_data" {
  bucket = "critical-data-storage"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }

  # ... other bucket configuration options ...
}

# This prevents accidental deletion of the critical data bucket.
# Terraform will throw an error if you try to destroy it.

```

2. create_before_destroy (In-place update not supported)
```
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = var.web_server_ami
  instance_type = var.web_server_type

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }

  # ... other instance configuration options ...
}

# This ensures a new web server instance is created with the updated configuration 
# before destroying the old one. This is useful when in-place updates are not supported 
# by the underlying service.

```

3. ignore_changes (External modification)
```
resource "azure_resource_group" "rg_webapp" {
  name     = "web-app-rg"
  location = "West US"

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [tags]
  }

  # ... other resource group configuration options ...
}

# This instructs Terraform to ignore any changes made to the resource group's tags. 
# This is useful if tags are managed by an external automation process.

```

4. precondition and postcondition (New in Terraform v1.2)
```
resource "null_resource" "security_check" {

  lifecycle {
    precondition = <<EOF
      aws_security_group.allow_ssh.id != null
EOF
  }

  # ... other null resource configuration ...
}

# This ensures the "security_check" resource is only created if the "allow_ssh" security group exists.

```
