### Example: Using a Data Source to Retrieve AWS VPC Information
In this example, we'll use a data source to retrieve information about an existing AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and then create a new subnet within that VPC.
```
# Define the provider. Here we are using AWS as the cloud provider.
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2" # Specify the region where the resources will be managed.
}

# Data source to retrieve information about an existing VPC
data "aws_vpc" "example" {
  # Filter criteria to find the specific VPC by its tag.
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name" # The name of the VPC tag attribute to filter on.
    values = ["my-vpc"] # The value of the tag to match.
  }
}

# Data source to retrieve information about available availability zones in the region
data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
  state = "available" # Only return availability zones that are in the available state.
}

# Create a subnet in the retrieved VPC
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id            = data.aws_vpc.example.id # Reference the ID of the VPC retrieved by the data source.
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24" # The CIDR block for the subnet.
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0] # Use the first availability zone from the retrieved data.

  # Define the tags to be associated with the subnet
  tags = {
    Name = "example-subnet"
  }
}

```

Using two data blocks in the provided Terraform example serves different purposes, each addressing specific needs for retrieving and utilizing existing infrastructure information. Here's why we have two data blocks:

### 1. Data Source Block for VPC (`aws_vpc`)

This data block is used to retrieve information about an existing VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) that matches certain criteria, specifically a tag with the name "my-vpc". The purpose is to obtain the ID of the VPC so that we can use it to create a subnet within that VPC.

### 2. Data Source Block for Availability Zones (`aws_availability_zones`)

This data block retrieves a list of availability zones in the specified region that are currently available. The purpose is to determine which availability zones can be used when creating resources, such as the subnet in this example.
