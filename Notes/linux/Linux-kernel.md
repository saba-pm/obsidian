In All Linux version, the kernel  doesn't different.  The difference  is command line and a little difference in the kernel. The user interface doesn't speak directly to kernel all request go to the system call interfaces and. Based on request, talk to the kernel.

User Interface (UI): This is the topmost layer where users interact with the operating system. It provides various graphical or command-line interfaces for users to perform tasks.

System Call Interface: This layer acts as an intermediary between the user interface and the kernel. It provides a set of APIs (system calls) that allow user applications to request services from the operating system.

Kernel: The core component of the operating system that manages system resources and hardware. It handles tasks such as process management, memory management, and device management.

Hardware: This is the physical layer consisting of the computer’s hardware components like the CPU, memory, storage devices, and other peripheral devices.

Arrows indicate the flow of interaction between these layers. User requests pass from the user interface down through the system call interface to the kernel, which then interacts with the hardware to execute tasks. The results are communicated back up through these layers to the user interface.
