count create list and when you change the resource

```
// Define a variable named "filename" with a default list of file paths
variable "filename" {
  default = [
    "/root/pets.txt",
    "/root/dogs.txt",
    "/root/cats.txt",
    "/root/cows.txt",
    "/root/ducks.txt"
  ]
}

// Define a resource block for local_file with the name "pet"
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  // Set the filename for each instance of the resource from the variable list using the count index
  filename = var.filename[count.index]


   // Set the filename for each instance of the resource from the variable list using the count index
  // Create as many instances of this resource as there are items in the filename variable
  count    = length(var.filename)
}

```


- **Variable Definition**:
    - `variable "filename"`: Declares a variable named `filename` with a default list of file paths.
- **Resource Definition**:
    - `resource "local_file" "pet"`: Declares a `local_file` resource named `pet`.
    - `filename = var.filename[count.index]`: Sets the `filename` for each instance of the `local_file` resource using an index from the `filename` variable.
    - `count = length(var.filename)`: Creates as many instances of the `local_file` resource as there are items in the `filename` variable.



Think you use count and count read from the file if something change from the file count can not understand difference and again create the resources to resolve this issue we use: 
- for_each
#### for_each

for_each does not work with list, we have two option to fix this issue: 
1. use set :
```
# Define a variable "filename" which is a set of strings, with default values being file paths.
variable "filename" {
  type = set(string) # Specifies that the variable is a set of strings.
  default = [        # The default value is a set of file paths.
    "/root/pets.txt",
    "/root/dogs.txt",
    "/root/cats.txt"
  ]
}

# Define a resource block that creates local files for each value in the "filename" variable set.
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  for_each = var.filename    # Iterates over each file path in the set.
  filename = each.value      # The filename for each file resource is taken from the set of file paths.
}

```

2.  toset
```
variable "filename" {
  type = list(string) # This specifies that the variable is a list of strings.
  default = [         # The default value is a list of file paths.
    "/root/pets.txt",
    "/root/dogs.txt",
    "/root/cats.txt"
  ]
}
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  for_each = toset(var.filename) # Iterates over each file path by converting the list to a set.
  filename = each.value          # The filename for each file resource is taken from the set of file paths.
}

```
